# 👋 Hi, I'm Hassan Mehmood

### 🚀 About Me  
I’m a **Drone Developer & Robotics Specialist** passionate about building intelligent, autonomous systems.  
With expertise in both **hardware and software development**, I design and integrate customized **UGVs, UAVs, and quadruped robots**.  

My work bridges cutting-edge research and real-world applications, focusing on:  
- 🐾 **Legged Robotics** – control, locomotion, and perception for agile quadrupeds  
- 👁️ **Computer Vision for Intelligent Robots** – perception pipelines and object tracking  
- 🤖 **Swarm & Autonomous Robotics** – distributed coordination and autonomous navigation  

Alongside engineering, I bring experience in **project management and technical leadership**, helping teams deliver impactful robotics solutions from concept to deployment.
